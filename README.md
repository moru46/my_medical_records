# my_medical_records

The Java app that is being developed is focused on creating a memorandum to store all information related to medical events such as visits, operations, exams, and other relevant information. The app will be designed to provide a comprehensive and convenient way for individuals to track their medical history and information.

The app will be built with a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, allowing users to enter and view information about their medical events. Users will be able to create and save notes about their experiences, including details about the date, time, location, and medical professional involved in each event. 

To ensure the security and privacy of the data, the app will implement appropriate security measures such as user authentication, encryption, and access controls. This will help prevent unauthorized access to the data, keeping it safe and confidential.
